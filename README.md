For the convenience of reading, I collect some basic and important papers about recommender system.

Here is the main categories:
 - KDD
 - ICDM
 - Cold Start
 - Survey
 - Distribution
 - Deep learning
 - Recsys
 - Talks
 - etc
 
 Also, I have collected some useful links:
 - [LibRec](https://www.librec.net/) A java library for the state-of-the-art algorithms in recommedner sytem.
 - [Surprise](http://surpriselib.com/)  A Python library for recommender system.
 - [Deep Learning](https://github.com/daicoolb/Deep-Learning-for-Recommendation-Systems) Deep-Learning-for-Recommendation-Systems
