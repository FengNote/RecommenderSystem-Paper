# Tips
For the convenience of reading, I collect some basic and important papers about recommender system.

Here is the main categories:
 - [KDD](http://www.kdd.org/) the community for data mining, data science and analytics
 - [ICDM](http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~icdm/) draws researchers and application developers from a wide range of data mining related areas such as statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, databases and data warehousing, data visualization, knowledge-based systems, and high performance computing. 
 - [AAAI](https://www.aaai.org/)  promotes research in, and responsible use of, artificial intelligence
 - [WWW](http://www.iw3c2.org/) provides the world a premier forum for discussion and debate about the evolution of the Web, the standardization of its associated technologies, and the impact of those technologies on society and culture
 - [NIPS](https://nips.cc/) has a responsibility to provide an inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone in the fields of AI and machine learning
 - [ICML](https://icml.cc/) is the leading international machine learning conference and is supported by the International Machine Learning Society (IMLS)
 - [CIKM](http://www.cikmconference.org/) provides an international forum for presentation and discussion of research on information and knowledge management, as well as recent advances on data and knowledge bases
 - [SIGIR](http://sigir.org/)  is the Association for Computing Machineryâ€™s Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval. Since 1963, we have promoted research, development and education in the area of search and other information access technologies.
 - [Recsys](https://recsys.acm.org/) the most famous conference in recommender system. 
 - Cold Start
 - Survey
 - Distribution
 - Deep learning
 - Talks
 - etc
 
**In this session, I have collected some useful recommeder system engine**:
 - [Mosaic](https://github.com/guymorita/Mosaic-Films---Recommendation-Engine-Demo) Mosaic Films is a demo of the recommendationRaccoon engine built on top of Node.js.
 - [Contenct Engine](https://github.com/groveco/content-engine) This is a production-ready, but very simple, content-based recommendation engine that computes similar items based on text descriptions
 - [Spark Engine](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/spark-recommendation-engine) This tutorial shows how to run the code explained in the solution paper Recommendation Engine on Google Cloud Platform. 
 - [Spring Boost](https://github.com/aerospike/recommendation-engine-example) How to build a recommendation engine with Spring Boot, Aerospike and MongoDB
 - [Ger](https://github.com/grahamjenson/ger) Providing good recommendations can get greater user engagement and provide an opportunity to add value that would otherwise not exist
 - [Crab](https://muricoca.github.io/crab/index.html) Crab as known as scikits.recommender is a Python framework for building recommender engines integrated with the world of scientific Python packages (numpy, scipy, matplotlib).

**In this session, I have collected some useful recommender system algorithm framework**:
 - [Surprise](https://github.com/NicolasHug/Surprise) Surprise is a Python scikit building and analyzing recommender systems.
 - [LightFM](https://github.com/lyst/lightfm) LightFM is a Python implementation of a number of popular recommendation algorithms for both implicit and explicit feedback, including efficient implementation of BPR and WARP ranking losses
 - [SpotLight](https://github.com/maciejkula/spotlight) Spotlight uses PyTorch to build both deep and shallow recommender models.
 - [Python-Recsys](https://github.com/ocelma/python-recsys) A python library for implementing a recommender system.
 - [LibRec](https://www.librec.net/) A java library for the state-of-the-art algorithms in recommeder sytem.
 - [SparkMovieLens](https://github.com/jadianes/spark-movie-lens) A scalable on-line movie recommender using Spark and Flask
 - [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/IBM/elasticsearch-spark-recommender) Building a Recommender with Apache Spark & Elasticsearch
