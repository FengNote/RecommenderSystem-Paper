# Tips
For the convenience of reading, I collect some basic and important papers about recommender system.

Here is the main categories:
 - KDD
 - ICDM
 - AAAI
 - WWW
 - NIPS
 - ICML
 - CIKM
 - SIGIR
 - Recsys
 - Cold Start
 - Survey
 - Distribution
 - Deep learning
 - Talks
 - etc
 
*In this session, I have collected some useful recommeder system engine*:
 - [Mosaic](https://github.com/guymorita/Mosaic-Films---Recommendation-Engine-Demo) Mosaic Films is a demo of the recommendationRaccoon engine built on top of Node.js.
 - [Contenct Engine](https://github.com/groveco/content-engine) This is a production-ready, but very simple, content-based recommendation engine that computes similar items based on text descriptions
 - [Spark Engine](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/spark-recommendation-engine) This tutorial shows how to run the code explained in the solution paper Recommendation Engine on Google Cloud Platform. 
 - [Spring Boost](https://github.com/aerospike/recommendation-engine-example) How to build a recommendation engine with Spring Boot, Aerospike and MongoDB
 - [Ger](https://github.com/grahamjenson/ger) Providing good recommendations can get greater user engagement and provide an opportunity to add value that would otherwise not exist
 - [Crab](https://muricoca.github.io/crab/index.html) Crab as known as scikits.recommender is a Python framework for building recommender engines integrated with the world of scientific Python packages (numpy, scipy, matplotlib).

*In this session, I have collected some useful recommender system algorithm framework*:
 - [Surprise](https://github.com/NicolasHug/Surprise) Surprise is a Python scikit building and analyzing recommender systems.
 - [LightFM](https://github.com/lyst/lightfm) LightFM is a Python implementation of a number of popular recommendation algorithms for both implicit and explicit feedback, including efficient implementation of BPR and WARP ranking losses
 - [SpotLight](https://github.com/maciejkula/spotlight) Spotlight uses PyTorch to build both deep and shallow recommender models.
 - [Python-Recsys](https://github.com/ocelma/python-recsys) A python library for implementing a recommender system.
 - [LibRec](https://www.librec.net/) A java library for the state-of-the-art algorithms in recommeder sytem.
 - [SparkMovieLens](https://github.com/jadianes/spark-movie-lens) A scalable on-line movie recommender using Spark and Flask
